# WeihanLi.Npoi

[NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/npoi) extensions for target framework net45 and netstandard2.0.

There' a lot of userful extensions for you, core fetures are as follows:

- mapping a excel file data to a `DataTable` or `List<TEntity>`
- export `IEnumerable<TEntity>` or `DataTable` data to Excel file or Excel file bytes or even write excel file stream to your stream
- export `IEnumerable<TEntity>` or `DataTable` data to csv file or bytes.
- custom configuration/mappings by Attribute or FluentAPI(inspired by [FluentExcel](https://github.com/Arch/FluentExcel/))
